				<p>Throughout the series, Kratos is portrayed as an antihero,often performing questionable actions. Although his backstory is seen in the original God of War, Kratos' childhood is revealed in Ghost of Sparta and the birth of his daughter is explored in the God of War comic series (2010–11). In Ghost of Sparta, it is revealed that the oracle had foretold that the demise of Olympus would not happen by the hands of the Titans—imprisoned after the Great War—but rather by a mortal, a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus, Athena, and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, Kratos' younger brother, who had a strange birthmark. Ares and Athena interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos in Sparta and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but Ares swept him aside and scarred him across his right eye. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured for many years by the god of death, Thanatos. Believing Deimos to be dead, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark, to honor his siblings.</p>

                    <p>Kratos, the central character in the "God of War" series, attains his powers through a multifaceted progression throughout the games. His journey begins as a mortal Spartan warrior who becomes a servant of Ares, the Greek god of war. Ares bestows upon him the Blades of Chaos, iconic weapons that consist of twin chained blades with attached razors. These weapons serve as his primary means of combat and destruction. Over the course of his quest for vengeance, Kratos earns the blessings of various Greek gods, granting him a wide range of godly powers and abilities. These powers are closely tied to the domains of the deities, encompassing abilities like manipulating lightning from Zeus, harnessing the sea from Poseidon, and wielding souls from Hades.

In "God of War II," Kratos acquires the Blade of Olympus, a god-killing weapon of immense power, following a series of epic confrontations. This blade enables him to unleash devastating attacks and manipulate energy on a divine level. Subsequently, in "God of War III," Kratos unlocks the extraordinary Power of Hope, contained within Pandora's Box. This newfound strength empowers him to overcome and vanquish the gods, including the formidable Zeus. 

In the 2018 installment of "God of War," which introduces Norse mythology to the series, Kratos employs the Leviathan Axe as his primary weapon. Throughout the game, he also obtains the Blades of Exile, reminiscent of his original Blades of Chaos, which are augmented with various magical abilities. His journey in the Norse mythological setting sees him adapt to a new pantheon of gods and mythological influences, including summoning the power of the Runes etched into his skin.

Overall, Kratos' powers in the "God of War" series are a reflection of his dynamic character evolution and the challenges he faces in his quest for revenge, redemption, and survival in various mythological worlds. These powers are central to the gameplay and storytelling, serving as a narrative and gameplay catalyst for his epic adventures.</p>
